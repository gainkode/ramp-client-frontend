/**
 * Checks if a data object matches the data source's filter string. By default, each data object
 * is converted to a string of its properties and returns true if the filter has
 * at least one occurrence in that string. By default, the filter string has its whitespace
 * trimmed and the match is case-insensitive. May be overridden for a custom implementation of
 * filter matching.
 * @param data Data object used to check against the filter.
 * @param filterName Filter string that has been set on the data source.
 * @returns Whether the filter matches against the data
